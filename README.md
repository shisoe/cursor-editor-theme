# cursor-editor-theme

I don't plan to publish this plugin in vs code so you can find the instructions on using the plugin on vs code.

---
* git clone the repo
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/shisoe/cursor-editor-theme
  ```
* install vsce
  ```
  npm install -g @vscode/vsce
  ```
* run the packager
  ```
  vsce package
  ```
---
then go to extensions > 3 dots > install from vsix > choose the vsix file generated after ```vsce package```
